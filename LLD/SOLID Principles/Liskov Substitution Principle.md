# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

## 1. What is Liskov Substitution Principle?
The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. It states:

**"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program."**

This principle ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without breaking the functionality of the application. It emphasizes maintaining the behavior expected by the superclass in the derived classes.

## 2. Where to Use Liskov Substitution Principle?
You should use the Liskov Substitution Principle in the following scenarios:

- When designing object-oriented systems to ensure robust and reusable code.
- In inheritance hierarchies where subclasses extend base classes.
- When working with polymorphism to maintain the integrity of behavior across derived classes.
- In systems requiring flexibility and scalability while ensuring functionality remains intact.

---

## 3. Why Use Liskov Substitution Principle?
The primary reasons for using LSP are:

- **Code Reusability:** Ensures that subclasses can seamlessly replace their parent classes without introducing errors.
- **Maintainability:** Simplifies understanding, updating, and debugging of the codebase.
- **Flexibility:** Encourages adherence to expected behaviors, making the system easier to extend.
- **Reliability:** Prevents unexpected behavior when using polymorphism.
- **Scalability:** Facilitates the addition of new subclasses without affecting existing functionality.

## 4. Pros and Cons of Liskov Substitution Principle
### Pros:
- **Encourages Robust Design:** Forces developers to maintain consistent behavior between base and derived classes.
- **Improves Code Quality:** Enhances code reliability and clarity.
- **Facilitates Extensibility:** Allows new subclasses to be introduced without modifying existing code.
- **Reduces Testing Overhead:** Ensures that derived classes don’t need separate tests for inherited behavior.

### Cons:
- **Requires Strict Adherence:** Developers need to rigorously follow this principle, which may introduce complexity in design.
- **Potential Overhead:** Adapting code to comply with LSP might require additional time and effort during development.

## 5. Analogy of Liskov Substitution Principle
Imagine a power outlet and a set of appliances:

- A power outlet provides electricity (the base class behavior).
- Appliances like a fan, a lamp, and a phone charger (subclasses) must all work with the power outlet without requiring modifications to the outlet.

If a phone charger required a different kind of outlet, it would violate the principle. LSP ensures that all appliances behave consistently with the outlet’s expectations.

## 6. Real-World Use Case of Liskov Substitution Principle
### Use Case: Payment Systems
In a payment processing application, there could be a base class `PaymentProcessor` that defines a method `processPayment()`. Derived classes like `CreditCardProcessor`, `PayPalProcessor`, and `UPIProcessor` should adhere to the behavior defined in `PaymentProcessor`.

If a `PayPalProcessor` deviates from the expected behavior and, for example, adds a non-standard verification step, it could break the system.

---

## 7. Code Example of a Real-World Use Case Using C++
Here’s a C++ example of adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class PaymentProcessor {
public:
    virtual void processPayment(double amount) const {
        cout << "Processing payment of $" << amount << "..." << endl;
    }
    virtual ~PaymentProcessor() {}
};

// Derived class 1
class CreditCardProcessor : public PaymentProcessor {
public:
    void processPayment(double amount) const override {
        cout << "Processing credit card payment of $" << amount << "..." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class 2
class PayPalProcessor : public PaymentProcessor {
public:
    void processPayment(double amount) const override {
        cout << "Processing PayPal payment of $" << amount << "..." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class 3
class UPIProcessor : public PaymentProcessor {
public:
    void processPayment(double amount) const override {
        cout << "Processing UPI payment of $" << amount << "..." << endl;
    }
};

// Client Code
void makePayment(const PaymentProcessor& processor, double amount) {
    processor.processPayment(amount);
}

int main() {
    CreditCardProcessor creditCard;
    PayPalProcessor payPal;
    UPIProcessor upi;

    vector<PaymentProcessor*> processors = {&creditCard, &payPal, &upi};

    for (const auto& processor : processors) {
        makePayment(*processor, 100.0);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base Class:** `PaymentProcessor` defines a common interface for payment processing.
2. **Derived Classes:** Each subclass (e.g., `CreditCardProcessor`, `PayPalProcessor`, `UPIProcessor`) adheres to the base class’s behavior while adding specific functionality.
3. **Client Code:** The `makePayment` function works seamlessly with any `PaymentProcessor`, ensuring compliance with LSP.
