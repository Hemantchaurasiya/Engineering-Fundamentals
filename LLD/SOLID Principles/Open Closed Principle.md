# Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

## 1. What is the Open-Closed Principle?
The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. It states that:

**"A class should be open for extension but closed for modification."**

This means you should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its existing code. By adhering to this principle, you can reduce the risk of introducing bugs into existing functionality while allowing the code to adapt to new requirements.

## 2. Where to Use the Open-Closed Principle?
The Open-Closed Principle is applicable in:

1. **Library or Framework Development**: To ensure changes do not break existing functionality when extending features.
2. **Plugin-Based Systems**: Such as systems supporting external plugins or modules.
3. **Dynamic and Scalable Applications**: Where future changes and enhancements are expected frequently.
4. **Applications with Polymorphism**: To allow new functionality through new derived classes.

---

## 3. Why Use the Open-Closed Principle?
The Open-Closed Principle is used because:

1. **Reduces Risk of Bugs**: Existing code is not modified, minimizing the chance of introducing bugs.
2. **Improves Maintainability**: Encourages creating modular and reusable code.
3. **Supports Scalability**: Makes it easier to add new features without impacting existing code.
4. **Encourages Abstraction**: Promotes use of abstract classes and interfaces for better design.
5. **Facilitates Testing**: Makes testing easier as new functionality is added without disturbing existing code.

## 4. Pros and Cons of the Open-Closed Principle

### Pros:
- **Prevents Regression Bugs**: Avoids modifying existing, tested code.
- **Enhances Code Flexibility**: New requirements can be implemented without touching old code.
- **Promotes Reusability**: Modular components can be reused in other parts of the project.

### Cons:
- **Initial Complexity**: Requires more thought and design upfront (e.g., creating abstract classes and interfaces).
- **Overhead**: Extending through inheritance or composition may add additional layers of abstraction.
- **Can Lead to Overengineering**: Over-application of this principle can make the system unnecessarily complex.

## 5. Analogy of the Open-Closed Principle

Imagine a power outlet in your home. The outlet's interface remains the same (closed for modification), but you can extend its functionality by plugging in different devices (open for extension), such as a lamp, a charger, or a heater. You donâ€™t need to modify the outlet every time you want to use a new device.

## 6. Real-World Use Case of the Open-Closed Principle

A common real-world example is a **payment processing system**. Different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.) can be added without modifying the core payment processing logic. By using interfaces or abstract classes for payment methods, you ensure that the system adheres to the Open-Closed Principle.

## 7. Code Example of a Real-World Use Case (C++)

### Scenario:
A notification system that supports multiple types of notifications (e.g., Email, SMS, Push). We want to add new notification types without modifying the existing notification processing logic.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>

// Abstract base class
class Notification {
public:
    virtual void send(const std::string& message) const = 0;
    virtual ~Notification() {}
};

// Email Notification
class EmailNotification : public Notification {
public:
    void send(const std::string& message) const override {
        std::cout << "Sending Email: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

// SMS Notification
class SMSNotification : public Notification {
public:
    void send(const std::string& message) const override {
        std::cout << "Sending SMS: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

// Push Notification
class PushNotification : public Notification {
public:
    void send(const std::string& message) const override {
        std::cout << "Sending Push Notification: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

// Notification Sender
class NotificationSender {
private:
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Notification>> notifications;

public:
    void addNotification(const std::shared_ptr<Notification>& notification) {
        notifications.push_back(notification);
    }

    void sendAll(const std::string& message) {
        for (const auto& notification : notifications) {
            notification->send(message);
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create notification sender
    NotificationSender sender;

    // Add different types of notifications
    sender.addNotification(std::make_shared<EmailNotification>());
    sender.addNotification(std::make_shared<SMSNotification>());
    sender.addNotification(std::make_shared<PushNotification>());

    // Send notifications
    sender.sendAll("Hello, Open-Closed Principle!");

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Abstract Class**: `Notification` defines the interface for notifications.
2. **Concrete Implementations**: `EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification`, and `PushNotification` extend the `Notification` class.
3. **Extension without Modification**: New notification types can be added by creating new classes that implement the `Notification` interface, without changing the existing `NotificationSender` or other classes.
